This repository contains python implementation of IBM Model1 for statistical machine translation.


Steps to Run:
	1.Open terminal
	2.run "python main.py" on terminal
	
	This will load the trained models for the translator and load the english and foreign dictionaries.

	Now,you will be provided with 4 options:
	Option 1: Translate the document-
				This option will ask you the path of the file to be translated and will store the translated document in a result file.

	Option 2: Calculate the different similarity measures like Jaccard Coefficient and Cosine Similarity-
				 This option asks user the path of document to be translated and the compare the output document with the original document and displays Jaccard Coefficient and Cosine Similarity between two Documents.
	
	Option 3: Calculate the average Jaccard Coefficient and Cosine Similarity for all the test doc pairs-
				 This option displays the average Jaccard Coefficient and Cosine Similarity to the user.

	Option 9: This option is used to exit from the process.
